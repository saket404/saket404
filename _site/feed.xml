There still some fruitful experiences which I salvaged from the ride. I wanted to take the time to share one of those experiences here. My experience as a Data Science Research Intern at Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, what triggered my decision to share my internship experience was not my direct desire to write about it. It was because of an observation I made about by myself with the current projects I have been working on. My approach to how I tackle these projects have completely changed (in a great way) compared to how I used to be prior to the internship. When I pondered about it, I concluded it was because of the learnings I picked up during my internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My objective is to share actionable learnings and suggestions from a wonderful experience. Without further ado, let’s get into it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student possessing a passion for data science trying to break into the field, I enrolled in the Master of Data Science coursework at the University of Melbourne. Upon the completion of my first year in the course, I had taken a few statistics, data analytics, and computer science subjects. While I found many of these courses intriguing and enlightening, I always wondered about the practical applications in the real-world of the knowledge I have picked up through these courses. To clarify my doubts and to have a clearer view of what kind of work a career in data science entails, I underwent a 3-month internship at Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP) as a data science intern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-mdap&quot;&gt;What is MDAP?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mdap.unimelb.edu.au&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Melbourne Data Analytics Platform&lt;/a&gt; (MDAP) is an organisation part of the University of Melbourne, working to enable data-intensive research across the disciplines by bringing expertise in data-intensive research, computation, and related infrastructure with the goal of increasing University of Melbourne’s capability for innovative, impactful and data-intensive research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mdap.unimelb.edu.au/#tab30&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Collaborations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mdap.unimelb.edu.au/2020/07/27/shaping-the-future-of-data-intensive-research/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Broshure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-role&quot;&gt;My role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked as a Data Science Intern collaborating with researchers to help enable data-intensive research. I was lucky to be able to work on multiple research projects from different domains. My projects included ‘analysing 6 billion social media posts to gain insights on gendered hate speech and domestic violence’, ‘developing a natural language processing pipeline to automatically extract information from legal judgements’, and ‘building an end-to-end web application’. The versatility in the projects I worked on enabled me to gain insight about data science applications in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;Learnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have an idea about my organization and role, I would like to shed some light on the most important part of this journey, my learnings. There is no doubt that I walked away from this internship with a significant enhancement of my data science skillset across both technical and soft skills. I would like to share a few of those learnings which I feel have been proven to be pivotal in the way how I approach problems in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;beginners-mindset&quot;&gt;Beginners Mindset&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creativehuddle.co.uk/how-to-adopt-a-beginners-mindset&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by CreativeHuddle they referred to a concept of the curse of knowledge from the book Made of Stick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has ‘cursed’ us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is really an interesting and right-on spot concept. I do believe everyone has once given our prior expertise and knowledge in a certain area find it difficult to observe things objectively. Looking back at myself, I used to be overconfident at times which mostly brought me to harm more than good. Observing my supervisors at MDAP made me realise to cope with this problem adopting a beginner’s mindset is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is being able to admit you lack the knowledge in the area, seeking out for help, and not being afraid to make mistakes. This way we always keep ourselves in the path of constant growth throughout our career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ask-questions&quot;&gt;Ask Questions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions or seeking out for help is probably one of the best ways to boost personal growth. You will be amazed at how many people do genuinely want to provide assistance to other people when sought after. I used to hesitate to ask questions due to the fear of turning out to be wrong or just out of embarrassment that it would be a “dumb” question and I think many people do too.
Working at MDAP surrounded by brilliant people, I found out that seeking help not only enlightened me but also improved my efficiency of performing any task. When I started at MDAP, I was overwhelmed with the abundance of information and was finding It difficult to keep up in my initial days. However, once I mustered up my courage and sought for help, I found out that it improved my efficiency to solve problems as just a pointer in the right direction by someone who has knowledge of that problem saves you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;real-world-problems-are-unstructured&quot;&gt;Real-World problems are unstructured&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This learning is probably more oriented toward data science. During studies, you are typically given project problems which you know have a solution to. You instantly know that if you are not able to solve it then you are doing something wrong. However, this is not the case in academia or industry. There are a plethora of challenges you face which are nothing like at what you expect at uni. Real-world problems are mostly unstructured and complex. 
Your mindset to solve the following problems must be different, you can’t just dive in and start implementing like you would on your uni assignments. I mean you could, but it would do more harm than good. It’s always a better idea to spend time on defining the problem and get to its root. Engaging in the discussion, seeking out suggestions and planning are probably the best ways to approach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-conclude&quot;&gt;To Conclude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still an abundance of other learnings I picked up during my time like, how crucial communication skills are, or how learning constantly is important to keep up etc. But the three learnings I elaborated above I feel are one which has impacted me the most in a positive way. I would also encourage anyone who is reading to take into consideration of incorporating these learnings if they have not been doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to acknowledge and compliment how the whole MDAP team always been supportive and helped me grow. Up until now, I have accomplished a lot, made a lot of mistakes and learnt from them, but I still have a long path ahead. My goals for this year are to complete my degree and secure employment in the data science field to further develop my skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to sign off with a quote from one of my supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Sucess is actually having the courage of working for something you are passionate about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/overlay.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Body transformation&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
      

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, losing weight is straightforward. Still many people including me struggle with it. Just because it’s a simple theory that doesn’t make it easy. Like many, my body transformation was a roller coaster ride with multiple fluctuations in my weight gain and multiple failed attempts at trying to lose weight. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong in gaining weight if you do it for a purpose (i.e. bulking) but mine wasn’t. Mine was more due to the inactive lifestyle (partly because of my eye surgery) and bad eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also was one of the people who love the idea of putting minimal effort and getting results quickly which was probably one of the reasons behind my drastic fluctuations where I would just give up after a month or so. It took me a few years to realise my mindset and approach was completely off. Not to approach it as just a weight loss phase with strict restrictive diets and drastic changes which were just detrimental on both my mental and physical health, but rather approaching it as a journey to achieve a sustainable and healthier lifestyle was the way to go. Now here I am, exercising often, eating healthy (most of the time 😜) and feeling happier with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-my-weight-gain-started&quot;&gt;When my weight gain started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never a skinny kid nor an obese kid growing up. My relationship with food was unhealthy with a junk food obsession and running away from veggies type. During those years I did not really think about what a healthy lifestyle meant, at that age who does? But I used to play a lot of sports and engage in physical activities often which may have been the reason I was not obese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during high school (9th grade) where I had a &lt;strong&gt;major eye surgery&lt;/strong&gt; and was prescribed 4 months complete bed rest post-surgery. My diet remaining the same but with minimal activity my weight increased significantly. Even post-surgery after I went back to school life, I was still restricted from playing sports for 1-2 years. My lifestyle became more sedentary and I was spending more of my time around gadgets. In addition to a sub-standard eating lifestyle consisting of highly-processed food most of the time my health was deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half &quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Pre and Post Surgery photos
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think many of you must have at least set a New Year’s resolution once, I did so too during my senior year (high school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This year with a new me…..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I will start engaging more in physical activity and follow a healthier diet by cutting out junk food. It all went down the drain with the eating lifestyle I promised myself to indulge in. However, I still did keep the physical engagement promise throughout the year. As a result, I did lose weight and it could be observed from my photos but I was not getting any healthier with the same frequent runs to the doctor (allergies, cold etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Senior Year (Grade 12)&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;realization&quot;&gt;Realization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I started my undergrad chapter pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering. The situation took a downfall. My physical activity engagement was down to zero, my eating habits got a lot worse. I used to stay up late most nights (3-4 am) which ended up in me devouring more food than I should eat. My life at that time consisted of sitting at the desk for a long period of time eating, studying and playing. This continued for over 2 years. I started to hate being in photos with my full body exposed, I despised myself while looking in the mirror and It was hard for me to find clothes that did not make me look obese. My body started giving signs as I suffered the occasional back pain and regular allergies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my junior year, I reached my peak weight (around 89 kg) and was suffering from constant knee pain and self-loathing, I knew I had to “&lt;strong&gt;STOP&lt;/strong&gt;” or else I won’t be able to cope with it in the future. These were still signals building up to me realizing I needed a change. The main reason was probably the day I blacked out for a moment. It may have not been directly related to my physique, but I knew it had something to do health which was probably getting worse because of my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half &quot;&gt;
  
    
      &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2018.jpeg&quot;&gt;
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2018.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Peak weight (89 kg)
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2017&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my goal (target weight of 75kg) and decided no matter what I did I won’t stop until I reached it. The goal was no different from what I used to set before the only difference was the determination to not give up this time. The first thing I did was cut down my diet drastically (cutting carbs completely in the evening because I read it was the way to go!) and started jogging regularly. It was really difficult at the beginning, but once I got used to it (hunger and soreness), it got easier. When I measured my weight, slowly I was down 2 kgs, then 5kgs and just like that I reached my goal. Once I got the taste of it, I wanted more so I continued with same diet (no carb at night) and reached 64 kg at one point (was a mistake!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half &quot;&gt;
  
    
      &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2019.jpeg&quot;&gt;
          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2019.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

          &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/body/2019-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;During the Weight loss phase
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was impressed I reached my weight goal, but I was still experiencing frequent cold and starting to hate my food choices. I was not eating unhealthily but my diet at the time still lacked food rich in nutrients and was basically bland (i.e. selected boiled veggies, meat). My mom used to tell me I started looking really thin, so I made up my mind and started weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I should have started a long way back, but I was one of the people who believed “weightlifting is bad for you, once you start and stop your muscle with turn into fat… blah.” myth. I really want to go back and give myself smack in the head for believing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this time I decided to change my approach completely and decided to focus on achieving a healthier and sustainable lifestyle rather than having a weight target to reach. I started incorporating various fresh foods in my diet by doing a lot of research, started exercising regularly by doing all sorts of activities (weightlifting, cardio, sports, yoga etc.). The most surprising thing I would say I started doing was probably cooking (because I never used to do this, hated it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half &quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the best shape I have been in both mentally and physically. Shockingly started seeing abs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 30%&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/body/best.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Physique 2020&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lifestyle changed completely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started being an early bird. (waking up at 5am)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started eating healthy (love it!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love cooking. Started making various different recipes (healthier version) and started to love them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exercising regularly (weightlifting, cardio, yoga, calisthenics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My future goals are enjoying and maintaining my healthy lifestyle, while my fitness goals are probably to gain a more muscular physique. My journey has been rough, but I learnt a lot. Here are several key learnings I picked up during this transformation journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-learnings&quot;&gt;Key Learnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-consistency-is-key&quot;&gt;1. Consistency is key&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is nothing new but indispensable. This applies to both you’re eating lifestyle and fitness. There is no shortcut when it comes to losing weight or achieving a healthy lifestyle. You need to progress slowly towards your goal with small steps. In my case consistency was the key difference in being able to achieve my goals compared to my previous failed attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-dont-jump-in-too-fast&quot;&gt;2. Don’t jump in too fast&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my weight-loss journey my goal was only to reach a target weight. That meant I gave my everything until I reached that goal. Even though I accomplished it, I started to hate my food choices and was hungry most of the time. Approaching goals in this sense were not sustainable as I would quickly succumb to old eating habits (junk food). Instead of going full in restrictive mode for a weight-loss goal, start slowly. Start my setting a small target which would require some effort but not too much that you would need to sacrifice everything (like losing .4kg a week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-work-on-your-form-before-progressing&quot;&gt;3. Work on your form before progressing&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when somebody knows you lift weights; you get questions like “how much do you lift?”. We often get idea that how good you are depending on how much weight you can lift. I also was under the same impression and progressed my weight rapidly rather than focusing on how accurately I was carrying out the exercise. I ended up getting my shoulder injured because of my poor form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not saying to not progress your weights, I am suggesting that the form of the exercises is being overlooked and people tend to focus on getting the number higher. So focusing on form is really important as it builds a foundation for your body to be able to build up strength for reaching that weight goal for the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;4-learn-to-let-go&quot;&gt;4. Learn to let go&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dont always need to feel bad everytime we miss our fitness goal or consume a huge cheatmeal. What feeling bad about these stuff does is it demoralizes you. I used to not be able to let go and felt bad about going out to a party (eating alot) and it would disrupt my routine and mindset because I wanted it to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, thinking back that party did not matter as it did not really affect my progress. So, learning to let go and assuring yourself it does not always need to be perfect is really important. If I have an unplanned cheat meal which breaks my calorie plan, instead of feeling bad I just carry on with my routine. It won’t really ruin my progress (However you should know your limits though). This applies to not only food, even to fitness goals you missed (No worries! try again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;5-measure-your-food&quot;&gt;5. Measure your food&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 25%&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/body/walnut.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Physique 2020&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more towards certain fitness goals you have set. For example, you would need to eat less or more depending on if you are cutting or bulking. Measuring your food comes in really handy as you have precise information of how much you are putting in your body. Food volume with respect to their calories can be deceiving and we may not be able to really estimate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I started tracking my meals by weighing, I saw how much I actually ate compared to what my estimates were when I was not weighing my food. It was quite surprising seeing how off I was with my estimates compared to how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-count-macros#macros&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; the food were actually worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I used to like snacking on walnuts. The amount of walnuts (on the right) I would just estimate it to around 15g before, turns out they are actually 30g (around 100 calories more!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;6-dont-give-up-on-the-food-you-love&quot;&gt;6. Don’t give up on the food you love&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to give up on foods you love just because you are on a restrictive diet. I used to do this and would feel miserable and hate my food choices (i.e. bland food). You can always cook a healthier version of recipes you love. Even for snacks you can always reduce the amount you consume by making it fit in your caloric goals. It’s not a sin to have an Oreo occasionally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to adjust and incorporate those foods into diet is way better and sustainable than giving up everything and feel miserable with your food choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sharing my story to show that no matter what it is if you put your mind to it you can do it!&lt;/p&gt;

I ofen used to face difficulties in moving files and connecting to remote servers on Windows or Mac OS then I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In this post I will show you how to connect to a remote server using SSH with Vscode and move files easily between your local computer and the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ssh-with-vscode&quot;&gt;Connect SSH with Vscode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#moving-files&quot;&gt;Moving files with Vscode between local and remote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Vscode docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH extension allows you to open a remote folder on any remote machine, virtual machine, or container with a running SSH server and take full advantage of VS Code’s feature set. Once connected to a server, you can interact with files and folders anywhere on the remote filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/official.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vscode docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created an instance on my univeristy’s (unimelb) cloud platform as illustrated in the figure below. I will be using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; instance for today where we will connect to the instance using vscode remote ssh. I have setup the instance with my public ssh key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can use any cloud platform as the basics would be the same. You would need your public key on the remote server (under authorized keys)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/0.png&quot; alt=&quot;dashboard&quot; title=&quot;University of Melbourne Research Cloud&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssh-with-vscode&quot;&gt;SSH with Vscode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, I assume you have an instance you want to connect and your public key resides on the server gaining you acess to it. Now using vscode to connect to the server can be done in 3 simple steps as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-install-extension&quot;&gt;Step 1: Install extension&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to first install the vscode extension for remote-ssh. You can do so by search for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; in the extensions and installing the extension as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;install&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-add-host-to-ssh-config&quot;&gt;Step 2: Add host to ssh config&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the extension has been installed an icon will be pop up on the left side menu where you can establish a new connection to a remote server (host) as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;host&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on add new host and enter the ssh command for connecting to the remote server and pointing to your ssh key. Choose the config file you want to add the host to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;connect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-connect-to-host&quot;&gt;Step 3: Connect to host&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote server (host) should be added to the list. In order to connect you can right-click and choose from the options based on you preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;choose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done! you can now connect your remote server and use its terminal in vscode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;done&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-files&quot;&gt;Moving files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great features of this extension is not requiring the use of another tool to move files between the remote server and your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uploading-files-to-remote-server&quot;&gt;Uploading files to remote server&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uploading files to remote servers can be easily done by simply dragging files to the vscode ui (under ssh) as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/move1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;png-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;downloading-files-from-remote-server&quot;&gt;Downloading files from remote server&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading files from remote servers can be easily done too by simply right-clicking and choosing download from the vscode ui as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/ssh/download.gif&quot; alt=&quot;png-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out additional features from the docs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy remote coding!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saket Khandelwal</name></author><category term="[&quot;Ssh&quot;]" /><category term="Ssh" /><category term="Vscode" /><summary type="html">Learn how and why to use Vscode for connecting to remote servers</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Access Dota game statistics using Python</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/python/access-dota-stats-using-python/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Access Dota game statistics using Python" /><published>2020-07-18T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-07-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/python/access-dota-stats-using-python</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/python/access-dota-stats-using-python/">&lt;p&gt;Recently I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendota.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenDota&lt;/a&gt; which is an open source platform where you can analyse and visualise you game stats. My goal today is to show you how to setup your OpenDota account to be able extract data using Python. This can be done with other programming languages but it is particulary useful doing this in Python as you can further perform analysis on your or other pro gamers statitics through the API using various Data Analysis libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opendota-api&quot;&gt;OpenDota API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendota.com/api-keys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenDota API&lt;/a&gt; is built upon the main OpenDota platform. You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.opendota.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation here&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation is nicely written and easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/dota-part1/opendota_docs.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenDota docs&quot; title=&quot;Open Dota docs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the OpenDota API to access your stats, you would first need to setup your account to be available on OpenDota platform. This can be done with 2 simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-sign-in-on-opendota&quot;&gt;Step 1: Sign in on OpenDota&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to let OpenDota calibrate your stats you will need to go the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendota.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenDota portal&lt;/a&gt; and sign in using your Steam account. OpenDota will automatically parse you games and extract statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/dota-part1/opendota_login.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenDota Steam Login&quot; title=&quot;Steam Login on OpenDota&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-retireve-account-id&quot;&gt;Step 2: Retireve Account ID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access your stats through the API we can see it requires an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;account_id&lt;/code&gt; which can be easily extracted once you login to the main OpenDota portal using your steam account. Your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;account_id&lt;/code&gt; will be seen on the website address which you can easily extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/dota-part1/steamID.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenDota docs&quot; title=&quot;Open Dota docs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thats all we need! Now lets do some programming!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extracting-data&quot;&gt;Extracting Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my steamID and the API path from the documentation, I have everything I need to extract my game data using Python. I will be using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library to access the endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'https://api.opendota.com/api/players/98166081/matches'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code above extracts data regarding all the matches played by me from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;matches&lt;/code&gt; endpoint (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.opendota.com/#tag/players%2Fpaths%2F~1players~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1matches%2Fget&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;docs here&lt;/a&gt;). There are a vast amount of endpoints you can utilise to extract data which can be read about in the documentation. Given the response is a JSON I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; library to parse the data into JSON format. I always use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; to manipulate data, just because how easy the library usage is and the abundance of features it provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà!, you have access to all your game stats now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to develop a personal blog for a while now. During my winter vacation, my friend (&lt;a href=&quot;https://abhinavcreed13.github.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abhinav&lt;/a&gt;) introduced me to jekyll and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal mistakes theme&lt;/a&gt;. It was the perfect time to explore markdown driven blogging as I had time on my hands. Once I started indulging myself into markdown driven blogging, I started to like how simple and easy it was to setup a blog and host it freely on github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally have mustered up enough courage, fought off my laziness and decided to start this blog. The purpose behind this blog is to share my experiences, learnings and activities which may be useful to others reading my articles. My goal is to share my knowledge as much as possible, so stay tuned!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like to sign off with a quote.&lt;/p&gt;
